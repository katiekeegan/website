The ubiquity of math is what mosts excites me about it - I enjoy thinking of math (and especially computational math!) as an artistic medium through which one can "paint a picture" of many social, scientific, and engineering situations (with the help of data-driven methods!).

My undergraduate research experience so far has involved researching existing math and computing techniques - mainly the SVD, PCA, and other ML algorithms - and exploring their uses in different fields. I've been involved in research involving COVID-19 data (one project involving public health data, and an ongoing project involving medical imaging) as well as cybersecurity, and my senior thesis will involve space science/surface geology in addition to machine learning.

In future research, I hope to further study the mathematical foundations of these techniques in machine learning and scientific computing and contribute to techniques that can better extract important features from high-dimensional, complex data.
