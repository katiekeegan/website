The ubiquity of math is what mosts excites me about it - I enjoy thinking about computational math and data-driven methods as an artistic medium through which one can "paint a picture" of many social, scientific, and engineering situations.

My undergraduate research experience so far has involved exploring the applications of various math and computing techniques (mainly the SVD, PCA, and other ML algorithms). I've been involved in research involving COVID-19 data (one project involving public health data, and an ongoing project involving medical imaging) as well as cybersecurity, and my senior thesis will involve space science/surface geology in addition to machine learning.

In future research, I want to further study the mathematical foundations of these techniques in machine learning and scientific computing, and I hope to one day contribute to math methods that can better extract important features from high-dimensional, complex data.
