## Flying

Thanks to funding from [Mary Baldwin University's Experiential Learning Grant](https://marybaldwin.edu/academics/experiential-learning-grants/), I have obtained a private pilot license and have taken lessons in Cessna 150, Cessna 172, and Cirrus SR-22 aircraft. Here is a [cool video](https://youtu.be/YhEA6PkSirU) I took during a night flight lesson of the MBU campus from the sky! 

I completed my first solo flight in September 2020 at age 16 and earned a private pilot license in December 2021 at age 17, after undergoing training in emergency procedures, night flying, basic instrument-only flying, and completing multiple solo cross-country flights to airports in Virginia and West Virginia. 

## Education

My own educational journey is a little nontraditional and has made me passionate about accessibility and equity in K-12 education. Here are some of my favorite education books!

- _Range_ by David Epstein
- _What School Could Be_ by Ted Dintersmith
- _Outliers_ by Malcolm Gladwell
- _Grasp_ by Sanjay Sarma

## International Studies and Philosophy

I've been fortunate to have spent around 2-3 months a year visiting my Japanese family for much of my life, during which I briefly attended kindergarten, elementary school, and middle school in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka. I am a dual citizen of Japan and the USA. These formative experiences inspired me to take MBU courses such as these:
- _Modern Political Thought: Global Justice_
- _International Relations_
- _Mediation and Conflict Resolution_
- _Intercultural Communication_
- _Politics of Food_
- _Gender in Asian Cultures_
- _Asian Art History_
- _Buddhism_
- [_Japan and Globalization: A Cultural Approach_](https://www.kansaigaidai.ac.jp/asp/files/academics/course-syllabi/fall-semester-2021/CUS2F21.pdf)
- [_Globalization, Culture, and Identity in Asia_](https://www.kansaigaidai.ac.jp/asp/files/academics/course-syllabi/spring-semester-2022/PSC1S22.pdf)
