## Flying

I've been dreaming of going to space since I was 11, and thanks to funding from Mary Baldwin University's Experiential Learning Grant, I was able to get a little closer to that goal. I'm currently working towards obtaining my private pilot certificate and have had the chance to take lessons in Cessna 150, Cessna 172, and Cirrus SR-22 aircraft. 

Here's a triumphant photo after I finished my first solo flight: ![flight](flight.png "First time flying alone!")

## Education

My own educational journey is a little nontraditional: I ended up going to college right after middle school when I was 14 through MBU's Program for the Exceptionally Gifted. I'm not a huge fan of the term "gifted", but I am extremely passionate about accessibility and equity in K-12 education for students of all ages, levels, and passions. 

I'm super happy to have gone to a public school and then transitioned to the diverse PEG program, where I got a much more well-rounded understanding of education and approaches that are appropriate for a broad range of students.

Here are some of my favorite education books!

- _What School Could Be_ by Ted Dintersmith
- _Outliers_ by Malcolm Gladwell
- _Grasp_ by Sanjay Sarma

## International Studies and Philosophy

I've been extremely lucky to have spent around 2-3 months a year visiting my Japanese family for much of my life. Although I spend most of my life physically in the States, I'm extremely grateful for opportunities like briefly attending Japanese elementary and middle school and taking coursework in Asian Gender Studies and Asian Art History at MBU.

Having this international upbringing inspired me to learn more about the connections between cultures and global worldviews in college. I loved exploring the intersections of cultural diversity and philosophy through these MBU courses:
- _Modern Political Thought: Global Justice_
- _International Relations_
- _Mediation and Conflict Resolution_
