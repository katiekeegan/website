I'm a big fan of this Albert Einstein quote: "I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious." Here are some things I like exploring in my free time!

## Flying

I've been dreaming of going to space since I was 11, and thanks to funding from Mary Baldwin University's Experiential Learning Grant, I was able to get a little closer to that goal. I'm currently working towards obtaining my private pilot certificate and have had the chance to take lessons in Cessna 150, Cessna 172, and Cirrus SR-22 aircraft. 

MBU was kind enough to feature my adventures in the sky on page 26 of [this magazine!](https://issuu.com/marybaldwinu/docs/mbu_magazine-winter2020)

Here's a triumphant photo after I finished my first solo flight: ![flight](flight.png "First time flying alone!")

## Art

Before coming to MBU, I was an avid participant in student art and jazz music competitions, and I used to participate annually in National Novel Writing Month (hopefully I'll get to do some more creative writing again soon!). Since beginning college, I've enjoyed exploring these interests through an academic lens.

My favorite example of this is my Pinhole Photography course, during which I spent every day of MBU's three-week May Term taking photos using a black-box pinhole camera, developing the paper negatives in a dark room, and even creating my own "camera obscura". After studying imaging applications in my undergraduate math research experiences, I loved looking at photography through a more artistic lens (pardon the pun) through this course.

Here is a link to some of my work from this class!

## Education

My own educational journey is a little nontraditional: I ended up going to college right after middle school when I was 14 through MBU's Program for the Exceptionally Gifted. I'm not a huge fan of the term "gifted", but I am extremely passionate about accessibility and equity in K-12 education for students of all ages, levels, and passions. 

Finding PEG was the culmination of a year of intensive research, during which I devoured every education book I could find (and tried to convince my parents to let me drop out of school and do just about any alternative schooling possible :sweat_smile:). In retrospect, I'm super happy to have gone to a public school and then transitioned to the diverse PEG program, where I got a much more well-rounded understanding of education and approaches that are appropriate for a broad range of students.

I hope I'll get a chance to be a teacher at some point in the future and give back to the educational community that has been so instrumental in my development so far.

Here are some of my favorite books on education, human growth, and learning in all forms!

## International Studies and Philosophy

I've been extremely lucky to have spent around 2-3 months a year visiting my Japanese family for much of my life. Although I spend most of my life physically in the States, I'm extremely grateful for opportunities like spending some time attending classes in Japanese elementary and middle schools while they were in session during my family's visits, visiting famous religious sites in Izu and Kyoto, and taking coursework in Asian Gender Studies and Asian Art History at MBU.

Having this international upbringing inspired me to learn more about the connections between cultures and global worldviews in college. I loved exploring the intersections of cultural diversity and philosophy through these wonderful MBU courses:
- _Modern Political Thought: Global Justice_
- _International Relations_
- _Mediation and Conflict Resolution_
