## Flying

Thanks to funding from [Mary Baldwin University's Experiential Learning Grant](https://marybaldwin.edu/academics/experiential-learning-grants/), I'm currently working towards obtaining my private pilot certificate and have taken lessons in Cessna 150, Cessna 172, and Cirrus SR-22 aircraft. 

## Education

My own educational journey is a little nontraditional and has made me passionate about accessibility and equity in K-12 education. Here are some of my favorite education books!

- _Range_ by David Epstein
- _What School Could Be_ by Ted Dintersmith
- _Outliers_ by Malcolm Gladwell
- _Grasp_ by Sanjay Sarma

## International Studies and Philosophy

I've been very lucky to have spent around 2-3 months a year visiting my Japanese family for much of my life. I've also been fortunate to attend kindergarten, elementary school, and middle school for periods of time in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka.

Having this international upbringing inspired me to learn more about the intersections of cultural diversity, philosophy, and history through MBU courses such as these:
- _Modern Political Thought: Global Justice_
- _International Relations_
- _Mediation and Conflict Resolution_
- _Intercultural Communication_
- _Gender in Asian Cultures_
- _Asian Art History_
