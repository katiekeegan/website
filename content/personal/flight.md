I'm a big fan of this quote of Albert Einstein: "I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious." Here are a few of the things I like exploring in my free time!

**Flying** 

I've been dreaming of going to space since I was 11, and thanks to funding from Mary Baldwin University's Experiential Learning Grant, I was able to get a little closer to that goal. I'm currently working towards obtaining my private pilot certificate and have had the chance to take lessons in Cessna 150, Cessna 172, and Cirrus SR-22 aircraft. MBU was kind enough to feature my adventures in the sky on page 26 of [this magazine!](https://issuu.com/marybaldwinu/docs/mbu_magazine-winter2020)
