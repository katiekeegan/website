I'm a big fan of this Albert Einstein quote: "I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious." Here are some things I like exploring in my free time!

## Flying

I've been dreaming of going to space since I was 11, and thanks to funding from Mary Baldwin University's Experiential Learning Grant, I was able to get a little closer to that goal. I'm currently working towards obtaining my private pilot certificate and have had the chance to take lessons in Cessna 150, Cessna 172, and Cirrus SR-22 aircraft. 

MBU was kind enough to feature my adventures in the sky on page 26 of [this magazine!](https://issuu.com/marybaldwinu/docs/mbu_magazine-winter2020)

Here's a triumphant photo after I finished my first solo flight: ![flight](flight.png "First time flying alone!")

## Art

Before coming to MBU, I was an avid participant in student art and jazz music competitions. Since beginning college, I've enjoyed exploring these interests through an academic lens during some arts-related coursework. 

My favorite example of this is my Pinhole Photography course, during which I spent every day of MBU's three-week May Term taking photos using a black-box pinhole camera, developing the paper negatives in a dark room, and even creating my own "camera obscura". After studying imaging applications in my undergraduate math research experiences, I truly loved learning both the art and physics of how photography works in this course. 

Here is a link to some of my work from this class!

## Education

My own path to college was a bit nontraditional: I ended up going to college right after middle school when I was 14 through MBU's Program for the Exceptionally Gifted. I'm not a huge fan of the term "gifted", but I am extremely passionate about accessibility and equity in K-12 education for students of all ages, levels, and passions. 

Finding PEG was the culmination of a year of intensive research, during which I devoured every education book I could find (and tried to convince my parents to let me drop out of school and do just about any alternative schooling possible :sweat_smile:). In retrospect, I'm super happy to have gone to a public school and then transitioned to the diverse PEG program, where I got a much more well-rounded understanding of education and approaches that are appropriate for a broad range of students.

I hope I'll get a chance to be a teacher at some point in the future and give back to the educational community that has been so instrumental in my development so far.

Here are some of my favorite books on education, human growth, and learning in all forms!
