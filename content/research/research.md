My undergraduate research experiences have explored the applications of various math and computing techniques. I've been involved in research involving COVID-19 data (one project involving public health data, and an ongoing project involving medical imaging) as well as cybersecurity, and my senior thesis will involve space science/surface geology in addition to machine learning.

In future research, I want to further study the mathematical foundations of these techniques. I hope to one day contribute to math methods that can better extract important features from high-dimensional, complex data while still having real-world applications that can be used to help others (e.g. medicine)!
