I am interested in the mathematical theories that make computational data analysis and AI/ML methods rigorous and scalable. In particular, I am interested in imaging and high-dimensional data analysis. 

I am especially excited by the ubiquity and applicability of computational mathematics. I love that the same foundational methods can be easily extended to applications in various data-rich science and engineering domains. My undergraduate research experience has primarily focused on application fields such as medical imaging/public health, media processing, and space science. 

I am honored to have received recognition of this research in a [SIAM News Article.](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/a-modified-watermarking-scheme-based-on-the-singular-value-decomposition)
