For my final project for Complex Analysis taken during Spring 2021, I chose to investigate the usage of complex analysis in the novel field of quantum computing. I wrote a course paper and presented to the class on the role of complex-valued matrices, the Bloch Sphere, and the Riemann Sphere in quantum computation.

As a part of my self-guided learning for this project, I also learned how to use [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/). After presenting upon the Bloch sphere and the relevance of complex analysis to quantum computing and quantum algorithms, I also provided a coding demonstration using [IBM Quantum Composter](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/) to the class.
