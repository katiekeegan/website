This project was completed in collaboration with two other students  and under the supervision of faculty advisors and teaching assistsants during the Summer@ICERM program with the 2020 theme of "Fast Learning Algorithms for Numerical Computation and Data Analysis." This work was presented at the following conferences:

- [Shenandoah Undergraduate Mathematics and Statistics Conference](https://www.jmu.edu/mathstat/sums/index.shtml)
- [SIAM Annual Meeting Undergraduate Session](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=72454)

**Abstract:** We introduce the singular value decomposition (SVD) along with some of its key
properties, illustrate its utility in image processing and audio processing, and show how this relates
to watermarking and digital ownership protection. After establishing experimental results regarding
image processing, we propose a modified version of a watermarking scheme introduced in Jain,
Arora, and Panigrahi, A reliable SVD based watermarking scheme, CoRR abs/0808.0309 (2008)
which offers improved robustness and imperceptibility properties.
