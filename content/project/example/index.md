Final project for MATH 306: Ordinary Diff. Eq. Modeled effects of elevator deflection on a Boeing-747 under cruise flight conditions using the Simulink Aerospace Blockset in MATLAB. Reported results and provided a mathematical analytical illustration of this control perturbationâ€™s effect on the system in a final paper.
