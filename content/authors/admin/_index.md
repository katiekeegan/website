Hello! I'm a 17-year-old junior studying Applied Mathematics with minors in Physics and Leadership Studies at Mary Baldwin University. I am interested in computational mathematics for data analysis and am especially passionate about problems related to healthcare and space science.

I began college at age 14 through the Program for the Exceptionally Gifted at MBU and will graduate college at age 18 next year. I am looking forward to applying to PhD programs in applied math, data science, and artificial intelligence in Fall 2021.
