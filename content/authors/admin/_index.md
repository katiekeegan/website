Hi! I'm a 17-year-old junior studying Applied Mathematics with minors in Physics and Leadership Studies at Mary Baldwin University. I am passionate about the computational and applied mathematics involved in the analysis of data, and am especially interested in problems related to healthcare and space science.

I started college when I was 14 through Mary Baldwin University's Program for the Exceptionally Gifted, and am excited to soon be starting my senior year of college at MBU! I am especially looking forward to applying to PhD programs in applied math, data science, and artificial intelligence in Fall 2021.
